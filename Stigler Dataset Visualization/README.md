In this visualization project, I have picked the dataset used in the stigler problem and visualized the relation between various parameters viz. price, content of protein, calcium, vitamins etc. of the food items in the dataset. This is a dataset that contains nutritional values of household commodities. This is the dataset that was used in the "stigler"-problem where the objective is to figure out how to minimise the costs of food while still getting enough nutrients.
